# Stock Price Prediction Dashboard

## 1. Overview

The **Stock Price Prediction Dashboard** is an advanced web application designed to forecast stock prices using machine learning techniques. It offers users an interactive interface to analyze stock trends and make predictions based on historical data. Built with Python and Streamlit, the application ensures an engaging user experience.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of this project include:
- To create an interactive dashboard for visualizing and predicting stock prices.
- To implement and evaluate various machine learning models for stock price forecasting.
- To equip users with tools that assist in making informed investment decisions.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Interactive Dashboard
- Developed using Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
- Allows real-time interaction for comprehensive stock data analysis.

### 3.2 Stock Data Visualization
- Displays historical stock prices in a user-friendly format.
- Visualizes predicted prices based on selected machine learning models.

### 3.3 Machine Learning Models
- Incorporates multiple algorithms for predicting future stock prices, including Linear Regression and LSTM Neural Networks.

### 3.4 User Input Functionality
- Enables users to enter stock tickers for live analysis and price predictions.

## 4. How to Use

### 4.1 Input Stock Ticker
- Access the input section of the dashboard and enter the stock ticker symbol for the stock you wish to analyze.

### 4.2 View Historical Data
- The dashboard will present the historical stock prices for the entered ticker symbol.

### 4.3 Predict Future Prices
- The machine learning model will provide predictions for future stock prices based on the historical data.

## 5. Model Overview

### 5.1 Linear Regression
- A fundamental yet effective model that assumes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable.

### 5.2 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network
- A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excels at learning long-term dependencies, making it particularly suitable for time series predictions.

## 6. Data Sources
- The historical stock price data is obtained from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance Python library, ensuring access to reliable and up-to-date financial data for analysis and prediction.

## 7. Required Libraries
The project relies on the following Python libraries:
- streamlit
- yfinance
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow (for LSTM model)

## 8. Future Developments

### 8.1 Model Enhancement
- Explore more sophisticated models to improve prediction accuracy.
- Fine-tune existing models to optimize performance.

### 8.2 Additional Functionalities
- Introduce features like news sentiment analysis and technical indicators for more thorough stock analysis.
- Implement user authentication to offer personalized dashboards.

### 8.3 Deployment Strategy
- Deploy the application on a cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku to enhance accessibility and scalability.
